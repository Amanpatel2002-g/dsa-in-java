When overriding the **equals()** method in Java, it's essential to also override the **hashCode()** method to maintain the contract required by hash-based collections such as HashMap and HashSet.[1][2][5]

## Reason for Overriding hashCode() with equals()

- The general contract states: **If two objects are equal according to equals(), they must also have the same hash code**.[5][7][1]
- Collections like HashMap, HashSet, and Hashtable use hashCode() to determine which "bucket" an object should be placed in. They then use equals() to check for actual equality within the bucket.[4][5]
- If two objects are "equal" by equals() but have different hash codes (because hashCode() is not overridden), they will go into different buckets. This leads to bugs, such as being unable to retrieve an object that was previously inserted into the collection using an "equal" key.[7][5]

## Example Scenario

- If equals() considers two Student objects with the same fields as equal, but their hashCode() generates different values, a HashMap may store both as different keys, or may fail to find the correct value.[5][7]
- Overriding both ensures **consistent and correct lookup, insertion, and deletion** in hash-based collections.[1][7]

## Key Contract Principles

- Equal objects → same hash code (must)
- Same hash code → may or may not be equal (allowed)
- Override both to guarantee hash-based collections function as expected[7][1][5]

Violating this contract leads to unpredictable and incorrect behavior in collection classes relying on hashing.[5][7]
